# Udacity-CNN
This repo is the result of a project I completed during my Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree on Udacity.

The task was to build a CNN from scratch to classify landmarks, obtaining 50% test accuracy, and then using transfer learning for the same task to achieve an accuracy of 70%.
My solutions are in the notebooks cnn_from_scratch.ipynb and transfer_learning.ipynb with behind-the-scenes code in the src folder.
The code templates were provided by Udacity and in addition, the helpers.py file was already provided. 

When training from scratch, I build a residual block architecture. When utilising transfer learning, I utilised the ResNet18 network. 

Many thanks to AWS for the shcolarship and Fady Morris Ebeid for the personal support.
